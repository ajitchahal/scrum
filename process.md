## Estimates

The team needs to define what can or cannot be done in the sprint: estimated effort vs capacity. **Estimation is often confused with commitments**. If estimates are used in a negative, confrontational way after the work is completed, then itâ€™s likely that future estimates will be either be much bigger to ensure they never are wrong again or the time taken to create them will be much longer as the team second guesses itself worrying about the implications of getting them wrong.
