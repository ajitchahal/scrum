# Scaling Scrum

This is known as a [nexus][1]

## Requirements

3 or more teams in 1 product

## When to scale

First: Don't scale scrum. Try everything else.

Remember: Scaling is not linear!! 2x teams does not mean 2x the work done

Don't scale just because you are late: "Adding man power to a late software project makes it later"

- Clear need for a team
- Scrum is already working well

# Scrum Scaling Frameworks

1. Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)
2. Scrum at scale
3. Scaled Professional Scrum (Nexus)
4. Scrum of Scrums
