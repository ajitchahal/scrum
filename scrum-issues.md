# Agile manifesto vs Scrum

`Responding to change over following a plan`

VS.
`- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal`

# Spotify

Spotify started off using scrum, but then realized it got in the way. They made it optional.
`Rules are a good start, then break them when needed`

Did away with the “Scrum Master” and renamed to “Agile Coach”. Independent squads that are autonomous and can scale without coordination. Loosely coupled, but tightly alignedAgile > ScrumPrinciples > Practices
Servant > Master
Autonomous Squads > Scrum team
Cross Pollination > Standardization
Focus on Motivation

Q. How does Spotify do x?
A. Depends on the squad

`Alignment enables autonomy`. If every team does whatever they want, then nothing gets deliever and managers are tempted to micromanage. Instead, managers should be crystal clear about what needs to be done, but then leave it up to individual teams to do it.

Keep systems small and decoupled with clear interfaces. Allow deployment to be however you want.

Release should be routine, not drama

Avoid handoff like the plague

`Agile at scale requires trust at scale`
This means no politics and no fear
